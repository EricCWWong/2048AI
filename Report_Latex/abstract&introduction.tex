    In this project, we explore the application of Reinforcement Learning to play the game "2048". We follow the original rules without simplifying assumption. We try two ways of representation for modeling the game and use Q-learning to identify the action-selection policy.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
From the four provided domains, we chose to model the game "2048" as our project. Because we are all interested in this game and it is fun to explore a familiar game with machine learning methods.
